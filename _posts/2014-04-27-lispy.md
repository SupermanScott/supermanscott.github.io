I took a few weeks of Paternity leave and I decided I needed a project to do while everyone else was blissfully sleeping. [Build your own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com/) has been on my radar for a little while and I decided I would complete the tutorial. It was a fun project to do some more C coding. I built it differently then the tutorial by using autoconf and automake. And it was built with [Minunit](https://github.com/siu/minunit) which is just a big set of Macros for testing. Wrapped it all up with a travis.yml to do the automation.

It was a fun project that I probably won't be maintaining. It would be fun to explore implementation of a [virtual machine](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/461052/Stack-based-vs-Register-based-Virtual-Machine-Arch).

Examples
--------
Calling functions
{% highlight clojure linenos %}
(+ 1 2 3) ;; 6
(- 8 9) ;; -1
(mod 10 2) ;; 0
{% endhighlight %}

There is also ways to comparisons
{% highlight clojure linenos %}
(== 1 2) ;; 0
(>= 4 4) ;; 1
(> 4 4)  ;; 0
(< 5 4)  ;; 1
(not (or (== 5 4) (< 3 2)) ;; 0
{% endhighlight %}

There are two functions that can produce side effects called print and error. Both display a message in the interpreter. Error prefixes the message with Error:. The real difference is error function with stop the evaluation of the s-expression.
{% highlight clojure linenos %}
(print "Hello World")
(error "Something failed :-(")
{% endhighlight %}

It is also possible to load a source file into the interpreter using the load function
{% highlight clojure linenos %}
(load "fizzbuzz.lisp")
(fizzbuzz_internal 1)
{% endhighlight %}

So as a great example of some of its abilities I wrote a solution to the [FizzBuzz Problem](http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/)
{% highlight clojure linenos %}
(fun {when c ev} {
     (if c
         ev
       {()})
     })
(fun {fizzbuzz_internal x}
     {when (<= x 100)
       {if (== (mod x 3) 0)
       {(print "Fizz")
       (fizzbuzz_internal (+ x 1))}
       {if (== (mod x 5) 0)
       {(print "Buzz")
       (fizzbuzz_internal (+ x 1))}
       {(print x)
       (fizzbuzz_internal (+ x 1))}}}
       }
     )
(fizzbuzz_internal 0)
{% endhighlight %}

Improvements
------------
The Q expressions are really ugly. They provide the only way to ensure that the s-expression isn't evaluated. It is mostly a part of the design decision to greedy evaluate the expressions. But by doing it this way, there isn't really a need for garbage collection.

The let function is also missing. Let function provides a real nice way to handle local state. lenv implementation allows for parent child relationship so that would work cleanly. The evaluation problem expressed above still holds for this. The body of the let would be evaluated before the arguments to let.
